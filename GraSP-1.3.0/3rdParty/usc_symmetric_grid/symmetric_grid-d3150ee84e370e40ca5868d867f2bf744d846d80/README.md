Fast Implementation for Graph Fourier Transforms based on Grid Symmetries
======

The code is to implement the block diagonalizations based on the results in [1]. It has been tested on MATLAB R2015b and R2016a.

The main function is proposed_blk_diagonalization.m. A short demo is also provided in demo_ds.m.
